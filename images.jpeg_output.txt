The interface is not merely a visual display - in fact, 
t's possible to have an interface with no visual 
display at all. A human interface iS the sum of all 
communication between the computer and user. 
It's what presents nformation to the user and 
accepts information trom the user. t's what actually 
puts the computer's power into the user's hands.
